# Object Oriented Optimists (OOO)
Team Programming Assignment #2 â€” "Zork++"

### To do:
- [ ] One Use Case description for each of your supplemental features. (2/x)
- [X] One or more UML class diagrams, created with a drawing tool (ArgoUML is one such choice, but anything that can draw UML diagrams will do) - Richard.

Several UML sequence diagrams:
- [ ] One showing the result of the player typing "score" and "health" back to back.
- [ ] One showing an item-specific command triggering a transform event into some other item.
- [ ] One showing an item-specific command triggering a teleport event.
- [ ] One for for each of your supplemental features.
- [X] Canonical examples of your .zork and .sav file formats - Richard.

To be crystal clear: your team will be turning in one submission for this group activity (see Zork-Plus-Plus Phase 1 OOO submission file).
