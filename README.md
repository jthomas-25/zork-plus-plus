### Team design assignment #4 — Zork++ implementation part 2

For phase 3b, your team will fully complete your Zork++ game engine, including all the supplemental features you previously designed. Yay!

I will obviously not post a test .zork file that is compatible with your supplementary features, because this is the point where every team's project is going to diverge from the others — different features will often result in different syntactic elements in the dungeon file.

Quite the contrary, each team member will be turning in their own .zork file for this submission, each of which illustrates all of your supplemental features. I'll be able to run your team's game engine on any of your team's super creative dungeons, providing me with hours of fun.
