Spencer Mansion

Note: Text inside quotation marks represents a typed command.

Steps:
1. Go "u" to the second floor (2F).
2. Type "take lockpick".
3. Go "d" to the Foyer.
4. Go "w" to the Dining Room.
5. Type "take emblem".
6. Go "n" to the Bar.
7. Okay, here's where it gets tricky (or tedious, as you'll soon find out).
   A LOT of backtracking to the Bar is involved. For that reason, I encourage
   you to draw your own map. I've provided a few hints below:
   
   7a. Type "push bookshelf", which will teleport you to a random room in the
       mansion. Keep track of the number of times you push the bookshelf. When
       you're done, you will have pushed the bookshelf a total of 9 times.
   7b. You can take the wolfMedal in the Secret Passage (type "take wolfMedal")
       if you want; you'll need it later anyway.
   7c. Eventually, you'll end up in the Study. If you're not there yet, keep
       pushing the bookshelf and making your way back to the Bar each time.
8. DO NOT "read" the Necronomicon! If you do, it will teleport you out of the
   Study and you'll have to get back there by pushing the bookshelf all over
   again. I'd recommend restarting the game at that point.
   Instead, first type "open Necronomicon", then type "take eagleMedal" to
   obtain the eagleMedal. Phew! The worst of it is over, I promise.
9. Type "polish eagleMedal" to be teleported out of this room.
10. Make your way back to the Bar.
11. Type "unlock e exit with lockpick".
12. Go "e" to the Secret Passage.
13. Type "take wolfMedal" if you decided not to take it earlier.
14. Type "unlock n exit with lockpick".
15. Go "n" to the Courtyard.
16. Type "unlock d exit with eagleMedal".
17. Go "d" to the Underground Lab Entrance.
18. Type "unlock n exit with wolfMedal".
19. Go "n" to the Underground Lab.
20. Go "w" to the Emergency Tunnel.
21. Type "unlock u exit with battery".
22. Go "u" to the Helipad.
23. Type "light flare".
24. Type "getIn helicopter" or "jumpIn helicopter" to win the game!
